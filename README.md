## Overview

What is your app? Brief description in a couple of sentences.

Interface that allows users to type any prompt and generate a small collection of images that can be minted on a blockchain testnet. Number of images generated will be at maximum 20 and all on-chain communcation will be with an existing testnet blockchain network.


### Problem

Why is your app needed? Background information around any pain points or other reasons.

Generating images has become easy with tools such as DALL-E, Mid Journey, etc. However, the ease to be able to develop multiple images and at the same time mint them on a blockchain is not available. The app offers a potential new one-stop-shop for minting NFT collections, reducing labor and time spent learning the intricacies of generating smart contracts.

### User Profile

Who will use your app? How will they use it? Any special considerations that your app must take into account.

The app is open to anyone that wants to generate an NFT collection and test out what they're prompts/ideas might produce. Developers may also be able to alter the app, adding new features for additional blockchain applications.

### Features

List the functionality that your app will include. These can be written as user stories or descriptions with related details. Do not describe _how_ these features are implemented, only _what_ needs to be implemented.



## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

### APIs

List any external sources of data that will be used in your app.

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

Describe your data and the relationships between them. You can show this visually using diagrams, or write it out. 

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
